      "content": "Catfish - (Callichthyidae) a genus of fish from the Callichthyidae family.\n\nOrigin:\nCentral America, northern and central parts of South America.\n\nGeneral Information:\nApproximately 145 species defined by scientific names are known, and about 130 species that have not yet been identified.\nCorydoras classification is based on color, body shape, and natural habitat location.\nIn 1970, Nijssen divided them into 9 groups based on color:\n1. Corydoras punctatus (with dark spots on the body and head)\n2. C. barbatus (with brownish spots on the upper and lower sides of the body)\n3. C. aeneus (with a grayish-blue color on the upper half of the body)\n4. C. nattereri (with a dark stripe separating the back and belly)\n5. C. eques (with a dark stripe along the upper part of the body)\n6. C. acutus (with grayish tones and a serrated pectoral fin)\n7. C. elegans (with a longitudinal stripe in brownish shades)\n8. C. caudimaculatus (with a dark spot near the tail)\n9. C. hastatus (particularly small-bodied Corydoras).\nIn 1980, Nijssen & Isbrücker reduced the groups to five based on similar principles. Further minor changes were made by them in 1983 and 1986, and in 1993, Burgess also contributed modifications. All these were based on color, body shape, and natural habitat.\nIn 1992-1993, C. Oliveira studied the chromosome count of approximately 30 species, finding the count ranged from 46 to 102. In 2002-2003, Marcelo R. Britto analyzed skull bones of various Corydoras species, revealing differences in skull structures across different species.\nCorydoras are typically raised in still or slowly moving waters. They thrive in clean water and prefer slightly acidic to soft water conditions, though they adapt well to harder, alkaline water. Water temperature should be 20-26°C.\nCorydoras feed only on the bottom, sifting through the substrate for food, and thus, gravel should be small-grained (2-4 mm). They are sensitive to any damage to their whiskers, which can easily become injured. Corydoras prefer live food but will eat most sinking freshwater fish foods.\nCorydoras are social fish and do well in groups of at least 4-5. They are very sensitive to even small amounts of salt in the water.\n"

This classification lasted for almost 20 years. In 1980, Kullander expanded the division into 7 groups, adding more distinguishing characteristics.\nIn 1982, Schmettkamp introduced a system of 9 groups based on habitat and added an additional group for species that did not fit into the existing groups.\nKoslowski divided Apistogramma into complexes in 1985, and this monophyletic classification is still in use today.\nThe current division includes 13 groups and 14 complexes:\n1. Apistogramma regani group (5 complexes)\n2. Apistogramma sp. Rotpunkt\n3. Apistogramma macmasteri group\n4. Apistogramma steindachneri group\n5. Apistogramma borellii group\n6. Apistogramma pertensis group\n7. Apistogramma sp. Balzfleck\n8. Apistogramma diplotaenia\n9. Apistogramma agassizii group\n10. Apistogramma gibbiceps group\n11. Apistogramma cacatuoides group\n12. Apistogramma trifasciata group\n13. Apistogramma sp.\nApistogrammas are typically territorial, especially during breeding. They are relatively peaceful with other small fish and inhabit the bottom third of the aquarium.\n"

American ichthyologist L.P. Shultz divided the group into four genera:\n1. Barbus (Cuvier, 1816)\n2. Barbodes (Bleeker, 1859)\n3. Capoeta (Valenciennes, 1842)\n4. Puntius (Hamilton, 1822)\nThis classification was based on the number of pairs of barbels the fish had.\nMost Barbus species in aquariums today are from Asia, though the genus also includes species from Africa and Europe. Sizes range from 1.5 cm to 2 meters, but most aquarium species are 5-9 cm in length.\nBarbus species are generally schooling fish that prefer to swim in groups. They require spacious aquariums with plenty of plants, logs, and rocks to provide hiding places.\n"

Approximately 70 species of rainbowfish are currently recognized.\nRainbowfish are known for their bright, colorful bodies, often with stripes. Sizes range from 6 to 16 cm, with their body depth reaching up to 40% of their total length.\nRainbowfish are social fish, best kept in groups in spacious aquariums with ample free swimming space and plants for cover.
